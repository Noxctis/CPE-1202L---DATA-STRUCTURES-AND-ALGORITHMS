# Group-1-CPE-1202L---DATA-STRUCTURES-AND-ALGORITHMS
This course is intended for first-year undergraduate students of computer engineering. The design and implementing of static and dynamic data structures and algorithms for systems and applications programming. The topics include algorithm implementation for recursive and iterative operations involving data structure implementations, including creation, destruction, insertion, deletion, traversals, sorting, and searching.


# Course Outcomes
By the end of the semester, the students should be able to:

**CO1**	Construct data structures and algorithms consistent with common engineering design situations.

**CO2**	Implement data structure and algorithm appropriate for solving a given scenario.
